## Captcha Service
A numeric captcha generator for Node.js. Has a built in fast server that will allow you to serve and validate captchas realtime. The use case that we built this for was to generate offline captchas (an internal requirement) where we can never use google captchas.

## Features (From the original GeorgeChan Library)
* Only generate numeric captcha PNG image
* Build-in fonts
* Characters up and down, left and right limits, random displacement
* Full JavaScript

## TODO List
- [ ] Async management of database.
- [ ] Server features to be added to docker.
